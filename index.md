- I love team games. I grew up playing team sports, and was on an intense dance team in college.
- Growing up with small-town Indian immigrant parents has given me the privilege of valuing Eastern spirituality and collectivism along with Western creativity and aspiration.
- My suburban childhood was filled with play. I try to approach life with a mindset based on play.
- The best decisions I’ve made thus far are (1) going to UT Austin from Chicagoland, (2) moving to Boston post-grad, and (3) studying abroad in Budapest. Each of these decisions involved new environments with new people, leading to great personal growth. Feeling myself become a better version of myself in these environments has led me to seek change and discomfort.
- I am interested in applying the investor’s mindset and processes to philanthropy. I was a student in, board member of, and now special projects lead for the [USIT Foundation](https://www.usitfoundation.org/), and I recently joined the [Highwind Impact Fund](https://highwindimpact.wordpress.com/).
- The current version of my entrepreneurial spirit is my pursuit of becoming a respected DJ and gatherer in Boston.
- If I could solve one problem, it would be the loneliness epidemic. I value community, and a long term goal of mine is to maximize the quantity of high quality relationships in my life. I wrote about it [here](https://jaigandhi.substack.com/p/reimagining-consumer-social?r=72hf1).
- My favorite professor told me that I should write down my five values and try to follow them each day. So far, I know three of my values are gratitude, harmony, and vitality. Ask me about the story behind each, or anything else, at [jaimgandhi@gmail.com](mailto:jaimgandhi@gmail.com).
